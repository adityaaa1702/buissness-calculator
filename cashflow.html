      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>Cash flow refers to the net amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a business during a specific period. It is a measure of a company's liquidity, indicating how much money is flowing in and out of the business. Cash flow can be positive, indicating a surplus of cash, or negative, indicating a cash shortfall.</p>

      <h2>Example: Profit Calculation</h2>
      <p>Let's consider a hypothetical scenario for a business that sells a product called "ABC Widget." Here are the financial details for the month of June:</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Item</th>
          <th>Amount</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Revenue</td>
          <td>$50,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fixed Costs</td>
          <td>$20,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Variable Costs</td>
          <td>$10,000</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Selling Price per Unit</td>
          <td>$100</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>To calculate the profit, we can use the following formula:<br>
      Profit = (Revenue - Fixed Costs) - (Variable Costs * Number of Units Sold)</p>

      <p>In our example, let's assume that ABC Widget sold 500 units during the month. We can calculate the profit as follows:<br>
      Profit = ($50,000 - $20,000) - ($10,000 * 500) = $5,000</p>

      <p>Based on the example above, the business earned a profit of $5,000 for the month of June. This indicates that after covering both fixed and variable costs, the business generated a positive return.</p>
